## Disclaimer
This post is a collection of things that I think are important to rember but I do not have time to look at right now.


## ALTREP
Project [ALTREP](https://svn.r-project.org/R/branches/ALTREP/ALTREP.html) provides an experimental framework for developing alternate representation of basic R objects. Starting with version 3.5.0 some results of ALTREP started to be released.

## All-Against-All
We are looking into computing all-against-all pairwise distances between SNP-Haplotypes. Therefore I had a look at analagous approaches of all-against-all pairwise sequence alignments (PSA)
