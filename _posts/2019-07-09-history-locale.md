A quick search will bring up a lot of hits on the topic. One example might be the page entitled [TwoHardThings](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html) by Martin Fowler. 

I like the above saying, but I want to mention that internalisation is not so easy either. If you are interested in why this is the case, please read on the [following story](https://charlotte-ngs.github.io/history_locale/history_locale.html).
