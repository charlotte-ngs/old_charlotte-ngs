### How is this new kid on the block called "Julia"?
Julia is a relatively new language for numerical and statistical analysis. Julia can be used interactively using the provided interpreter in a so called "read-evaluate-print-loop" (repl). Julia functions are compiled using JIT compilation. This combines the advantages of fast interactive development and fast execution of compiled code. 

### Local version
Julia can be downloaded for free from http://julialang.org. It is either available as commandline tool run from a terminal or in an IDE called Juno. On the Mac installation of both Julia CLI and Juno worked without any problems. On windows there were a few firewall related issues which prevented Juno to connect to Julia. 

### Julia in the cloud
A very convenient alternative to installing Julia or Juno on your local machine is to point your browser to http://juliabox.org, and either create an account or use your Google drive account. On juliabox one can either work with raw Julia text files or with iPython notebooks. 

### Syntax
The syntax of Julia is comparable to Matlab or Python.

### A first example
A first example of some simple Julia code is shown at: http://charlotte-ngs.github.io/GettingStartedWithJulia/FernandoGarrick2013Notes.html

Enjoy!!
