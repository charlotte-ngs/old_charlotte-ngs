Batman plots have been produced many times. An earlier version is given at https://guangchuangyu.github.io/2011/08/the-batman-equation/. The author already used `ggplot2` for drawing the plot. The input for the `ggplot2`-routines consisted of dataframes that were prepared based on the parts of the [Batman equation](http://www.hardocp.com/news/2011/07/29/batman_equation/). 

More recently an approach that directly used the constituting parts of the Batman equation as arguments for the plotting routines is given on [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/projects/db982efa-e439-4e2d-933b-7c7011c6b21a/files/Public/batman-curve.sagews?session=default). 

If you are interested in how the same approach as on CoCalc can be used with R and `ggplot2`, please keep on reading [here](https://charlotte-ngs.github.io/BatmanPlot/BatmanPlotPost.html).
