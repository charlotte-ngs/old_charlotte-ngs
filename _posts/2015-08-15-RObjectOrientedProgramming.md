I learned object-oriented programming from the author of [Object Oriented Software Construction](http://www.amazon.de/Object-Oriented-Software-Construction-Prentice-engl/dp/0136291554). Then I got more and more interested in data analysis where R is one of the main tools. Coming from languages like C++, Java or Eiffel, R's concept of object oriented programming is quite different. 

Also at the beginning, it felt strange to have more than one object-oriented class system in one language. But on the other hand it also gives users the freedom to choose which system best fits to their needs.

To get more familar with object oriented programming in R, I have done some experiments which are documented in this [companion post](http://charlotte-ngs.github.io/RExperimentsWithS4RC/ExperimentsWithS4AndRef.html). Please read on and enjoy!
