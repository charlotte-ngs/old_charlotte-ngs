title: Introduction to R 
---

When working with big data which is certainly the case in the area of
next generation sequencing (NGS), it is important to have a set of tools 
or a system that supports the user in managing and analysing the available 
data. 

## The R System
In statistical data analysis [R](http://www.r-project.org) has become very 
popular. The philosophy of R is similar to the one of Unix of building a system 
using small tools. Hence the base of R is relatively small. But that small base 
can easily be extended by a large number of packages. The Comprehensive R Archive 
Network [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/) is the main repository for packages 
extending the functionality of the R system.

## Bioconductor
When working with data from Bio- or Life-Sciences, [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org) 
is a very valuable resource. Bioconductor does not only provide a large set of 
R packages but it does also offer standardized workflows and example datasets. 
In general Bioconductor documentation is provided by vignettes following the 
paradigm of reproducible research.

## Why R
Because first of all R is very fast in prototyping and second R is easy to extend 
either by writing packages in R or by using its interfaces to other languages. 

Dirk Edelbuettel explained why to use R in a [Google Tech Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZkaZhsOfT4)

## R Crash Course
Learning how to use a system like R is associated with a certain learning curve. 
Some people pretend that this curve is especially steep when learning how to use R. 

As an introduction, I have put together some slides which I would use to introduce 
R to an audience without prior knowledge. In case you are interested you can [read more
