Given a set of time-intervals between a start-time and an end-time, we want to sample a pre-defined number of random time-points within each interval. The blog post linked below shows a few experiments and concludes with a function that gives a first solution to the problem. Still interested, please read on [here](https://charlotte-ngs.github.io/RandomTimepoints/20180402_RandomTimepointsDocu.html).
