At the time I was putting together some slides on an [introduction to R](http://charlotte-ngs.github.io/RCrashCourse), I wanted to integrate something very basic about linear modelling. But very soon I realized that this would be too much material for one series of slides. Hence I decided to put away the material on linear models for a separate post and a new series of slides.

The introduction to multiple linear regression comes in two versions. First, an example analysis of the Chatterjee–Price Attitude dataset is described in a [blog post](http://charlotte-ngs.github.io/MultLinRegInR/notes/2014-11-04-MultipleRegressionInR.html). Second, the same material is also presented as a [series of slides](http://charlotte-ngs.github.io/MultLinRegInR/slides/MultLinRegInR.html) which can freely be used for courses or presentations. 

## Disclaimer
The description of the multiple linear regression analysis is based on a course on Computational Statistics taught by Martin Mächler and Peter Bühlmann at ETH Zurich. The [course notes](http://stat.ethz.ch/education/semesters/ss2014/CompStat) contain more topics than just multiple linear regression and are certainly worth while having a look at. I want to thank both authors for this course and for sharing their course notes online.
