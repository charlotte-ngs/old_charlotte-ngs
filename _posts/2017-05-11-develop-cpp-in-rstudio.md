When developing software systems in a compiled language such as C++, IDEs (Integrated Development Envirionments) are important. IDEs for C++ such as VisualStudio on Windows, XCode on MacOs or Eclipse are widely used and are known for their extensive set of functionalities. 

For beginners, most of these tools have a rather steep learning curve. For developers in R, RStudio has become a quite popular IDE. The goal of this post is to test with a small example how RStudio can be used for developing C++ programs.
