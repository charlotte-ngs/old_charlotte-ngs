[XSim](http://qtl.rocks/XSim/index.html) (aka. as "Cross-Sim") is a powerful [`Julia`](https://julialang.org/)-package for simulating genomic data. The methods implemented in the package is described in

> Cheng H, Garrick D, and Fernando R (2015) XSim: Simulation of descendants from ancestors with sequence data. G3: Genes-Genomes-Genetics, 5(7):1415-1417.

An introduction to the use of the package was given at the workshop of "Whole Genome Analyses Using Julia" taught by the instructors Rohan Ferando (Iowa State) and Chris Stricer (agn) at TUM School of Life Sciences Weihenstephan, Freising, Germany.
