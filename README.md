# old_charlotte-ngs
Old version of blog posts published previously on charlotte-ngs. The old version of the website consisted of a blog that was written as RMarkdown pages converted by the knitr package and served by jekyll on GitHub pages. The new version is produced by the blogdown package and Hugo is used as site generator. The whole site is still served by GitHub pages.
